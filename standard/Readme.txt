* The KNX Handbook is automatically opened if you insert the CD.
  If it does not open, double-click the file "index.htm" in the
  root of this CD.
  Automatically running the CD is only possible if the Auto insert
  notification is enabled for your CD-ROM drive. This can be set
  on the page Settings of the properties of your CD-ROM drive in the
  MS-Windows Device Manager.

* For your convenience, you may copy the entire contents of this CD
  onto your hard disk (like on "c:\KONNEX CD"). If you copy all files
  in a single directory and keep the directory structure as on the CD,
  you can keep using the browser to explore the Handbook.

* Only a few files are for consistency reasons provided in the
  compressed WinZIP file format.
  If you do not have WinZIP installed on your computer, you
  can obtain a license or download a trial version via
  http://www.winzip.com.

* All documents are provided in the Acrobat PDF-file format.
  If you are unable to view PDF-files, you can install the
  software Acrobat Reader for Windows provided in the directory
