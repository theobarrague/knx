<p>  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dear Reader,<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>KNX Association</em></strong> hereby offers you the set of documents that constitutes the complete fourth release of the <strong>KNX</strong> specification. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong> KNX</strong> is the Worldwide standard for the control in intelligent homes and buildings, as enshrined in the European standards EN 50090, EN 13321, the worldwide standard ISO/IEC 14543-3 as well as the Chinese standard GB/T 20965. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This release of the specification again integrates most of the application notes published since version 2.0, containing new system features and updated/clarifications of the various chapters and volumes. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> These documents will help your company's strategists and developers throughout the process of planning, designing, developing and testing of smart and high quality products for home and building control.<br>
  <br>
  For any building - commercial or residential, individual or collective, small- or large-scale, public or private &ndash; the <strong>KNX </strong>specification covers the full scope of applications and communication media of integrated automation and control, including </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lighting, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shading, shutters and blinds, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; household appliances, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heating, cooling, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ventilation and air-conditioning, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; access and security, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remote meter reading, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; energy management and safety, <br>
  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &hellip; </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The circumstances, environment and arguments that will bring you to the decision to buy a new <strong>KNX </strong>dishwasher for your home are completely different from the decision making processes the management of your company will have to follow, when they will decide to equip the new corporate headquarters with thousands of smart <strong>KNX </strong>components for Building Control. Between these two extremes, we will find the typical professional contractor who installs electrical, heating or cooling equipment.<br>
  <br>
  It is obvious that to cover such a range of products and solutions, not only the applications themselves have to be addressed: <strong>KNX </strong>therefore offers several Configuration Modes, catering for these various needs - and does so in a compatible way, encouraging rich cross-interaction between all subsystems, irrespective of their application domain, Configuration Mode or physical communication medium.<br>
  <br>
  For <strong>KNX</strong>, a flexible installation is no hollow phrase. Each installation can be extended and new functionality can be added as demands evolve. The physical communication media that are described in the <strong>KNX</strong> specification have proven to accommodate effectively all practical market and installation needs &ndash; with retrofitting and refurbishment gaining market share.<br>
  <strong>KNX</strong> in actual fact consolidates a treasury of field experience and dominant market presence, collected over more than 20 years by <strong><em>KNX Association</em></strong>, its legacy associations&nbsp; 1) and members, so none of the material you will find on the market is untested, hypothetical or academic.<br>
  <br>
  The specification is divided into volumes, to which you can browse on this CD-ROM, incorporate this established know-how and shows working documents for possible future extensions. The content of the CD-ROM assures the commitment shown by so many leading companies in the preparation of this specification; it also shows that the specification was written with hard, commercial objectives in mind.<br>
  <br>
  To underline this statement even more forcefully, you will find a substantial amount of hardware, safety and rigorous test specifications included. They translate the formal system description &ndash; itself crystallized around product-centric requirement profiles &ndash; into a set of operational and measurable requirements. Have your new products tested through our <strong><em>KNX Association</em></strong> Certification - the procedure is also described in these volumes - and you can exhibit your product with the valued <strong>KNX</strong> conformity label.<br>
  <br>
  With this new release of the <strong>KNX</strong> specification in hand, we would like to express our gratitude to the numerous experts of so many companies, who participated in the various <strong><em>KNX Association</em></strong> Working Groups and Task Forces with the objective, continuous improvement of the <strong>KNX</strong> specification.<br>
  <br>
  Those who were involved in the editing, reviewing and production of these documents are convinced that you will see the value of this unique specification. </font></p>
