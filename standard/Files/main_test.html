<center><b><font size=-1>De</font><font size=-2>ar Reader,</font></b><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>The set of documents you are currently browsing consitutes
the first full release of the specification of the KNX system for intelligent
homes and buildings, proposed to you by the Konnex Association. These specifications
are the output of a collective effort on the part of our Association and
its core member companies, representing over 20&nbsp; person-years of intensive
work. They will accompany your company's strategists and developers throughout
the process of planning, designing, developing and testing smart building
products.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>For any building, no matter whether commerical or residential,
individual or collective, small-scale or large, public or private - KNX
covers the full width and depth of integrated automation and control applications,
including:</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>lighting</b></font>
<br><b><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shading, shutters and blinds</font></b>
<br><b><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; household appliances and
white goods</font></b>
<br><b><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heating, cooling</font></b>
<br><b><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ventilation and airconditioning</font></b>
<br><b><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; access and security</font></b>
<br><font size=-2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</font></center>
<font size=-2></font></td>

<center><font size=-2>Now clearly, the situation where you decide to buy
a new KNX diswasher and have it installed in your family home, is definitely
different from the one where a system integrator equips your company's
corporate headquarters with thousands of smart KNX components. In between
these extremes, we find the typical professional contractor who installs
electrical, heating or cooling equipment. It is obvious that to cover such
a range, not only the applications themselves have to be addressed: KNX
indeed offers several Configuration Modes, catering for these various needs
- and does so in a compatible way, encouraging rich cross-interaction between
all subsystems,</font>
<br><font size=-2>irrespective of their application domain or&nbsp; configuration
Mode.</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>Even though all off this is truly a historical first,
KNX in actual fact consolidates a wealth of field experience and dominant
market presence, collected over more than 12 years by the Konnex legacy
associations(*) and their members. So none of the material you will find
here is untested, hypothetical or academic; the volumes in front of you
incorporate this established know-how, and extend it. And rest assured
that the commitment shown by so many leading companies in the preparation
of this specification was only given with hard,</font>
<br><font size=-2>commercial objectives in mind. To put it simply: this
stuff is real!</font><font size=-2></font>
<p><font size=-2>Underscoring this statement even more forcefully, you
will find a substantial amount of hardware,</font>
<br><font size=-2>safety and no-nonsense test specifications here.</font>
<br><font size=-2>The latter translate the formal system description -
itself crystallised around product-centric requirement Profiles -&nbsp;
into a set of operational</font>
<br><font size=-2>and measurable requirements. Fulfill these through our
Konnex Certification, the principles of which are also described in these
volumes, and you can adorn your product with the coveted KNX conformity
label.</font></center>

editing these documents would like you to join in and profit from this
unique offer. Welcome to the world of Konnex.</font><font size=-2></font>
